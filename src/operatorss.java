        We will learn about the operators today
        1) Comparing Operator :
            --> Are used to compare two value.
            --> A==B    A is equal to B
            --> A!=B    A is not equal to B
            --> A>B     A is greater than B
            --> A<B     A is smaller than B
            --> A>=B    A is greater or equal to B
            --> A<=B    A is smaller or equal to B
        2) Logical Operator
            --> Is used to find the logical values between values
            --> A==B && A<5 : Return true if the two conditions are met   [and]
            --> A<B || A<C : Return true if one of the conditions in met   [or]
            --> !(A<B) : Return false if the result is true and visa versa
